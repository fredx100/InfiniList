# InfiniList
An android list app with infinitely nestable lists.

Items have a title and description, and may have one of a number of "checked" states or not.
Any item may have an arbitrary number of subitems.

There are no bells and whistles - if you don't like lists, and nesting lists at that, this probably isn't for you.
But, really, what kind of person doesn't like lists?
