A list app with infinitely nestable lists.

This app allows nested lists. That is, a list item may have its own sub-list. Further, items in any sub-list can have their own sub-list. It's lists all the way down!

Items have a title and description, and may have one of a number of "checked" states.

Features:
<ul>
<li>Nested lists!</li>
<li>Human readable list export.</li>
</ul>
